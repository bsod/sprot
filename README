That's all there is to it.

SUBMITTING PATCHES
==================

You're obviously more than welcome to contribute to this
program, but there are a few things to keep in mind.

1) Keep the ChangeLog file up-to-date. The easy way to do
   this from emacs is using hotkey 'C-x 4 a' or the verbatimg
   command 'add-change-log-entry-other-window'.
